# PLANET DEFENDER 
I started my strategy-based game by coding the path that enemies would follow. For this, I created a structure called Transferpoint. Transferpoint points can be placed in different positions for each level. The enemies are designed in 2D and have animations for walking, getting hurt, and dying. Each enemy has a different walking speed and health, which adds a strategic element to the game.
